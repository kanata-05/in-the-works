# in-the-works
Small projects of mine that are in the works. (Later shifted to a repository of their own) 
Also containing a list of projects that I have in mind.

### Chat AP
  A basic chat application that communicates over TCP, not very secure,  
  built for inter-network communication

### pie@home (This project has been moved to a repo, https://github.com/kanata-05/pie-at-home/)
  A volunteer computing project where multiple clients can contribute into the calcuation of pi (Our goal is 400 trillion digits)  
  This program will use the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula (or BBP) since it has the ability to  
  calcuate any digit of pi without having to calcuate the preceding digits, this ability is what   
  will enable us to distribute the computation tasks across devices. This program was inspired by  
  Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), SETI@home and Minecraft@home.  
  However there is a major problem with such a program and that being, How to verify the computed digits of pi?  
  (without recalcuating)

# Finished Projects

### Image Recognition
  A Neural Network capable of recognizing images and their contents, currently can recognize basic Images  
  however, it's accuracy is rather bad and it cannot recognize humans.

### ~~Spinning Cube~~ Spinner
  It is now a spinner. 
  Added the ability to spin all .stl files (added .obj too but isn't working)  
  W/S to increase/decrease the spin velocity, A/D to increase/decrease model size  
  Z/X to zoom in/out.  
  
### QuantumSmartAIPoweredSuperNeuralNetworkNFTBlockchainDecentralisedWeb3Shell  
  A shell where you can just use normal basic english to specify what you want to do,  
  The LLM processes it and comes up with a command (yes, the name is intentional :3)  

## polyglot  
  A program which can run in multiple languages without any errors  
  Currently works in (Javascript, Python) and (Whitespace, Trigger, Brain-Fack, Perl 6,  
  05AB1E, Pip, Thutu, Hexagony, Underload, Nim, Prelude, Reng, Cardinal, Julia, Pyth, Haystack,  
  Turtlèd, Ruby, Fission, Befunge-98, Befunge-93, Perl 5, Retina, Japt, SMBF, Python 2, ><>,  
  Minkolang, V/Vim, Python 3)

## pifind  
  Find any sequence of digits in pi, uses the chudnovsky algorithm to calcuate pi (where's the fun in a pre-calcuated one)  
  Usage: `./pifind [-t <int>] -s <int>`  
  -t value is the number of seconds until timeout (program stop) in order to avoid strain on the system, if left unspecified,  
  the program will run until the string is found.  

  -s value is the sequence of digits to find.
