# in-the-works
Projects of mine that are in the works. (Later shifted to a repository of their own) 
Also containing a list of projects that I have in mind.

## polyglot  
  A program which can run in multiple languages without any errors  
  Currently works in (Javascript, Python) and (Whitespace, Trigger, Brain-Fack, Perl 6,  
  05AB1E, Pip, Thutu, Hexagony, Underload, Nim, Prelude, Reng, Cardinal, Julia, Pyth, Haystack,  
  TurtlÃ¨d, Ruby, Fission, Befunge-98, Befunge-93, Perl 5, Retina, Japt, SMBF, Python 2, ><>,  
  Minkolang, V/Vim, Python 3)

## pifind  
  Find any sequence of digits in pi, uses the chudnovsky algorithm to calcuate pi (where's the fun in a pre-calcuated one)  
  Usage: `./pifind [-t <int>] -s <int>`  
  -t value is the number of seconds until timeout (program stop) in order to avoid strain on the system, if left unspecified,  
  the program will run until the string is found.  

  -s value is the sequence of digits to find.


## Image Recognition
  A Neural Network capable of recognizing images and their contents, currently can recognize ~~hand~~mouse-written digits  
  Trained on the MNIST dataset using tensorflow and keras, 128 neurons, 2 hidden layers.
