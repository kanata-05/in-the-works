### Chat AP
  A basic chat application that communicates over TCP, not very secure,  
  built for inter-network communication

### Image Recognition
  A Neural Network capable of recognizing images and their contents, currently can recognize basic Images  
  however, it's accuracy is rather bad and it cannot recognize humans.

### ~~Spinning Cube~~ Spinner
  It is now a spinner. 
  Added the ability to spin all .stl files (added .obj too but isn't working)  
  W/S to increase/decrease the spin velocity, A/D to increase/decrease model size  
  Z/X to zoom in/out.  
  
### QuantumSmartAIPoweredSuperNeuralNetworkNFTBlockchainDecentralisedWeb3Shell  
  A shell where you can just use normal basic english to specify what you want to do,  
  The LLM processes it and comes up with a command (yes, the name is intentional :3)  

## polyglot  
  A program which can run in multiple languages without any errors  
  Currently works in (Javascript, Python) and (Whitespace, Trigger, Brain-Fack, Perl 6,  
  05AB1E, Pip, Thutu, Hexagony, Underload, Nim, Prelude, Reng, Cardinal, Julia, Pyth, Haystack,  
  TurtlÃ¨d, Ruby, Fission, Befunge-98, Befunge-93, Perl 5, Retina, Japt, SMBF, Python 2, ><>,  
  Minkolang, V/Vim, Python 3)

## pifind  
  Find any sequence of digits in pi, uses the chudnovsky algorithm to calcuate pi (where's the fun in a pre-calcuated one)  
  Usage: `./pifind [-t <int>] -s <int>`  
  -t value is the number of seconds until timeout (program stop) in order to avoid strain on the system, if left unspecified,  
  the program will run until the string is found.  

  -s value is the sequence of digits to find.
