Projects of mine that are in the works. (Later shifted to a repository of their own)

## encryptor  
  A encryptor which layers a whole bunch of ciphers and more (and to actually encrypt it, it uses AES-256 at the end)  

## pifind  
  Find any sequence of digits in pi, uses the chudnovsky algorithm to calcuate pi (where's the fun in a pre-calcuated one)  
  Usage: `./pifind [-t <int>] -s <int>`  
  -t value is the number of seconds until timeout (program stop) in order to avoid strain on the system, if left unspecified,  
  the program will run until the string is found.  

  -s value is the sequence of digits to find.
